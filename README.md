The frontend, built with React and Next.js, ensures a smooth and responsive user experience, making property browsing a breeze. Users can easily filter and search for properties based on their preferences, location, and budget, allowing them to find the perfect match effortlessly.

Behind the scenes, the site admin handles property management with ease. Using a user-friendly backend powered by Node.js, property details are added, edited, and managed efficiently.
